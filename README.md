# Donut-Cop
An Android game developed for a school project a couple of years ago. This is just a sample, the code is very poorly written but represents one of my first ever projects.

The project was built using Gideros Studio and was one of my first ever projects in the 9th grade. The approach is messy but I didn't find any time to revisit the game.

## Concept

The premise of the game is to use to joystick to avoid the obstacles coming your way.

## Functionality

The main features:
* Increasing difficulty

## Compatibility

Since the application was built using __Gideros Studio__, the project can be exported for a variety of platforms: Android, iOS, Windows, HTML5. Again, the project is experimental and built solely for fun with no intention of exporting it.
